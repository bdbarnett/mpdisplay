class Area:
    """
    Represents a rectangular area defined by its position and dimensions.

    Attributes:
        x (int | float): The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the area.

        w (int | float): The width of the area.
        h (int | float): The height of the area.

    Methods:
        contains(x, y): Checks if the specified point is contained within the area.
        contains_area(other): Checks if the specified area is contained within the area.
        intersects(other): Checks if the current Area object intersects with another Area object.
        touches_or_intersects(other): Checks if the current Area object touches or intersects with another Area object.
        shift(dx=0, dy=0): Returns a new Area shifted by the specified amount in the x and y directions.
        clip(other): Clips the current Area object to the specified Area object.

    Special Methods:
        __eq__(other): Checks if the current Area object is equal to another Area object.
        __ne__(other): Checks if the current Area object is not equal to another Area object.
